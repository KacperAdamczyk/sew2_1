Create a class Car with the following requirements:
1. Contains constructor accepting parameters:
   Color (may be string or enum or anything which makes sense)
   Make  (may be string or enum or anything which makes sense)
   FuelConsumption (should accept floating point)
   TankCapacity (can be integer)

2. Exposes readonly properties (or something else if your language does not support properties) for the values provided in constructor
3. Exposes readonly property for:
   FuelLevel
   Odometer
   DailyOdometer

4. Should have Refuel method accepting litres of fuel with protection from negative value. The FuelLevel cannot be more than TankCapacity
5. Should have Drive method accepting number of kilometers. The maximum distance you can go depends of the current fuel level and fuel consumption. It should increase Odometer and DailyOdometer. Both odometers should have limits like in real car.
6. Should have ResetDailyOdometer method which zeroes the daily o

Create a class Network with the following requirements:
1. Represents a valid computer network in IPv4 standard
2. Exposes constructor accepting two parameters: string with valid network address and number with valid prefix length. Should throw proper exceptions when values are incorrect.
3. Should expose readonly properties (or other language constructs if your language does not support properties) for the following:
	Broadcast - returns string with broadcast address for this network
	First - returns string with first usable address in this network
	Last - returns string with last usable address in this network
	Network - returns string with network address

4. Should have a method to split network into couple of smaller networks. The number of smaller networks is passed in parameters.
The result should be array of Network.
5. Should have a method to split network into couple of smaller networks of unequal size. The parameter provided to the method determines the s
